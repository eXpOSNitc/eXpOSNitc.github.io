                           <p>eXpOS stands for eXperimental Operating System. The <a href="os_spec.html" target="_blank">eXpOS specification</a> describes a very simple multi-user multi-tasking operating system. </p>   
                           <p>eXpOS is not intented to be used as a practical operating system.  It is designed with the following intentions:
                           <ol>
                              <li>To have a multi-tasking OS specification that can be comprehended by a junior undergraduate student in computer science who is undergoing a first course in Operating System such that he/she will be able to implement the OS in two or three months. This educational package comes with enough guidance and support tools as well as documentation to allow the student to achieve this goal without the supervision of a specialist teacher.</li>
                              <li>The student will write the complete code for the OS from scratch.  He/She will not be building the OS on top of a given code base.  The only programming support provided will be a compiler for a programming language (called SPL) in which the OS kernel will be written.  </li>

You will learn how to:</p>
                           <ol>
                              <li>Initally load the operating system from secondary storage to memory – <b>Bootstrapping</b>.   </li>

                              <li>Handle allocation and de-allocation of memory to processes – <b>Memory Management</b> (also includes a virtual memory implementation).  </li>
                              <li>Manage organization of data and program files in secondary storage – <b>File Management</b>.</li>
                              <li>Implement a mechanism to allow multiple processes to share files/memory – <b>Resource Sharing</b>.</li>
                              <li>Realize primitives that help application programs to avoid inconsistency when resources are shared by several processes executing concurrently – <b>Process Sychronization</b>.</li>

                           <p>The experiment is akin to guiding a third year aerospace engineering student to build a small unmanned flight in two months.   (The flight will not be usable outside the laboratory!)</p>

                           <p>People who want to learn about operating systems,  but who belong to the following category are not advised to proceed with eXpOS:</p>
                              <ol>
                                 <li>You are a confident programmer comfortable with reading and understanding professionally written code – like the source code of linux.   In this case, more sophisticated packages like <a href="http://minix3.org/">Minix</a> allow you to do real hard stuff.   However, this is not for novices. </li>
                                 <li>You are not an expert;   you want to try out the things listed in FAQ 2,  but you do not want to do dirty work at a low level.  (Although you can avoid assembly language programming in the eXpOS project, you still will have to get into quite a bit of  “low level” architectural details).   We suggest you to look for alternatives like <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tom/nachos/" target="_blank">NACHOS</a> or <a href="http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/~topsy/" target="_blank">TOPSY</a>. </li>

                           <p>What you learn is very little compared to what is needed to become an OS expert.  So, listing out everything is impossible.  But here are some important misses: </p> 
                           <ol>
                              <li>The XSM machine allows you to store a character string in a memory word. No real machine architecture permits you to do such stuff.  This is made possible just because XSM is a software simulated.   However,  XSM makes your data manipulation job much simpler without getting bogged down by details of data formatting. It is in principle possible to implement eXpOS on “more real” machines like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_instruction_set" target="_blank">MIPS</a>.  However, this would involve considerably more time and effort.  </li>
                              <li>The project involves very little work involving input-ouput, device interfacing, security or networking.  Moreover the file system is a very primitive one.  </li>
                              <li> The methods studied won't scale up to multi-core machines or when there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking#Preemptive_multitasking" target="_blank" > pre-emptive multitasking </a>.   These topics are beyond the scope of the project. Moreover, the file system and the multiuser support are very simple but primitive. </li>

SPL is a simple programming language which essentially is an extended assembler for the XSM machine, specifically designed for the eXpOS package.</li>

This language is used for writing application programs that can run on top of eXpOS.  You will be using this language for writing some of the user level programs of the OS including the shell. Test programs that are used to test your OS will also be written in ExpL.</li>
                              <li>An interface tool called <a href="support_tools-files/xfs-interface.html" target="_blank">XFS-interface</a> that allows you to transfer data files and executable programs from your Unix/Linux system into the hard disk of the XSM machine (called xfs-disk).</li>

                        <div id="collapse10" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                           <p>It is difficult to answer this question for all similar packages available elsewhere, but here is a comparison with NACHOS. </p> 
                           <p>NACHOS learning system asks you to implement OS software that allows application programs in the noff executable format, running on a the software simulation of a MIPS machine, to invoke system calls.   However, the OS code you write really doesn't run on the MIPS machine!  Your code is actually C code running on your Linux/Unix machine.  When an application program invokes an OS system call, the MIPS simulator transfers control to a corresponding “stub” function in the simulating environment.    You must write C code in the stub to do “whatever is expected from the OS” to satisfy the calling application program invoking the system call.   Since the MIPS machine is simulated, your code has access to its memory, registers etc.  Thus you can implement the system call, put return values in appropriate memory locations on the simulated MIPS machine and transfer control back to the calling program.  </p>
                           <p>In eXpOS, the OS and the application programs run in the same machine as is the case in real systems.  The compromise made in achieving this goal was to make the machine “unreal” and the OS  simple enough so that additional complexity is manageable for a short term project.   </p>

                           <p><a href="http://xosnitc.github.io/" target="_blank">XOS</a> is an earlier version of this project.  XOS did not support blocking system calls.</p>
                           <p> This means that a process will never do a context switch while it is running in the kernel mode. However eXpOS, system calls may block in the kernel mode and other processes could be scheduled.  The version of XSM provided with eXpOS has the necessary hardware support for doing this.</p>
                           <p> The addition of this single feature makes the eXpOS substantially more complex than XOS. This is because a blocked process might have made partial updates to some OS data structures before blocking and a newly scheduled process, while executing in the kernel mode, must be careful not to modify these data structures and leave the OS in an inconsistent state. </p>
                           <p> Apart from the above feature, eXpOS adds support for semaphores, shared memory, file locking etc. There is also limited multi-user support. However, the additional complexity introduced by these features is minor. </p>

This code must load the rest of the OS into memory during bootstrap. </p>

                           <p>In a multitasking OS like Linux, there are two types of programs running. Firstly, there are application programs that users write. These are called "user mode programs". Secondly, there are "kernel mode programs" which constitute the OS code.  These routines implement the system call interface for application programs and other OS functions like process, memory, file and device management etc. </p> 
                           <p>User mode programs can execute only a restricted instruction set and has access only to a limited memory (called the virtual address space).  These programs must invoke OS system calls to do tasks which involve capacity beyond their limited instruction set.   Kernel mode programs on the other hand have full access to the machine instruction set. </p>
                           <p>Any machine supporting eXpOS needs to recognize and support two modes of program execution.  The OS must be designed such that the machine switches to kernel mode when a user mode program invokes a system call and goes back to user mode when the system call returns.  This requires architecture support.  XSM machine is equipped with the necessary hardware support. </p>

                           <p>We need separate programming systems for writing user mode programs and kernel mode programs because these languages serve different purposes. The high level language - ExpL provided with the package can be used for writing application programs that run on top of the operating system.  However, ExpL does not support low level programming necessary to write the OS.  The SPL language (which is essentially an enriched XSM assembly language) must be used to write the OS modules.</p>

                           <p>The ExpOS library is an application program that provides a generic interface for other application programs to access OS services like system calls and dynamic memory management routines. High level application programs that access the OS services through the library interface will be architecture independent. </p>
			   <p>ExpL permits applications to invoke OS routines only through the library interface.  The compiler simply translates the library call to a low level library call.   However, ExpL compiler will not link the library to the application at compile time. The OS loader must link the library to the application at run time.  </p>
