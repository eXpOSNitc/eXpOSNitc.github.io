              <b>Analysis of Student Feedback (2018):</b>
              <ol>
                <li>Almost every respondent reported that they could complete Phase
                  3 (process management) in both the courses (100% at NIT Calicut
                  and 95% at IIT Palakkad).</li>
                <li>42% of the students at IIT Palakkad and 50% of the students at
                  NIT Calicut noted that their background in computer organization
                  was insufficient.
                  <br> Interaction with students seem to suggest the following
                  issue. Computer organization typically are based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture"
                    target="_blank">MIPS architecture</a> and tend to stress more
                  on the fetch execute cycle, pipelining, cacheing and other architectural
                  design level issues, but lays less stress on page table address
                  translation and the semantics of instructions like push, pop,
                  call, ret and interrupt/exceptions that manipulate the stack.
                  However these ideas need to be understood clearly for doing the
                  project.
                </li>
                <li>53% of the respondents at IIT Palakkad and 88% of the respondents
                  at NIT Calicut noted that 90% of the project can be done completely
                  based on the road map.</li>
                <li>48% of the respondents at IIT Palakkad (and 76% at NIT Calicut)
                  completed Phase 5 (process management, interprocess communication
                  and file system implementation). 33% among those who completed
                  Phase 5 at IIT Palakkad (respectively 47% at NIT Calicut) completed
                  all the phases of the project.
                  <br> The disparity in the effectiveness of the road map and the
                  performance statistics in the courses at NIT Calicut and IIT
                  Palakkad is due to the following. The course at NIT Calicut was
                  an elective and hence only students who had sufficient interest
                  and background to follow the project roadmap had enrolled for
                  the project (64 of a total of 158 CS students (40%)). At IIT
                  Palakkad, the project was part of a compulsory core course.
                </li>
                <li>88% of the respondents at NIT Calicut and 68% of the respondents
                  at IIT Palakkad reported that doing the lab gave a clear advantage
                  in understanding the theory.
                  <br> The difference appears to be due to the difference in the
                  instructional methodology adapted for the OS theory course (core
                  in both the institutions). At NIT Calicut, the theory course
                  had a huge (150+) student enrollment and followed a standard
                  theory approach based on <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1412284"
                    target="_blank">Silberschatz et. al.,  Operating System Concepts</a>.
                  On the other hand, at IIT Palakkad, the class size was small
                  (30+) and the course was based on the OS kernel design approach
                  based on <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=524414"
                    target="_blank">C. Crowley Operating Systems: A Design-Oriented Approach</a>.
                  As the latter text covers many of the design issues encountered
                  during the project, the enforcement that the laboratory gave
                  to the understanding of theory was less dramatic.
                </li>
                <li> Whereas 22% of the students at NIT Calicut who completed Stage
                  5 or above reported that more than 15 hours of work per week
                  was needed for the project, only 11% of the students at IIT Palakkad
                  who completed Stage 5 or above reported so. 67% of the respondents
                  at IIT Palakkad who had completed Stage 5 or above responded
                  that 10-15 hours/week was sufficient whereas only 44% of the
                  respondents at NIT Calicut reported that 10-15 hours/week was
                  sufficient. These differences appear to be linked to the differences
                  in students' prior exposure to programming in the respective
                  institutions.
                  <p>Consequently 87% of the respondents at NIT Calicut noted that
                    the project helped them in improving their coding skills, whereas
                    only 37% of the respondents at IIT Palakkad noted that the
                    project improved their coding skills.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <b>Analysis of Student Feedback (2019):</b>
              <ol>
                <li>60% of respondents at NIT Calicut felt that their background was
                  sufficient as compared to 31% in 2018. This is due to the following:
                  A few theory lectures were arranged in the beginning of the semester
                  to discuss background material in computer organisation (paging
                  and address translation, interrupts and exceptions and other
                  features of XSM which are significantly different from the MIPS
                  architecture). Moreover, one senior student volunteer who had
                  done the project in the previous was assigned to mentor each
                  student doing the project in the present year. These steps helped
                  to solve the difficulties substantially. We conclude that conducting
                  a few theory lectures on topics in computer organization that
                  are relevant to the project at the beginning of the course can
                  bring about substantial improvements in student performance.</li>
                <li>There was a significant increase in the percentage of students
                  who reported that the project brought about substantial improvements
                  to their coding skills (from 24% to 46%). On discussions with
                  students to analyze this feedback, the following was observed.
                  We had made substantial improvements to the XSM debugging environment
                  (which is more or less similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger">GDB</a>                  environment) before the laboratory was run in 2019. We had also
                  insisted that the students be familiar with the debugging environment
                  at an early stage of the project. Many students reported that
                  the project helped them in improving their code debugging skills
                  considerably; and this resulted in many students reporting that
                  the project improved their coding skills in the feedback form.</li>
                <li>A significant drop in the percentage of students completing Phase
                  5 (file system implementation) was observed (from 76% in 2018
                  to 48% in 2019). Upon checking the facts which lead to this drop,
                  we found that a significant percentage among the 84% students
                  who had completed Phase 4 was working on the file system implementation,
                  and the feedback was collected before they could complete the
                  file system implementation. Most of these students had completed
                  subtaintial parts of the file system. Hence, we still expect
                  that 60-75% of the class to successfully complete (the whole
                  or significant parts of) the file system implementation phase
                  when the course is conducted in future as well.</li>
